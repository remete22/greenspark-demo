# greenspark test

This is a test proejct for greenspark senior frontend job.

## The requirement are:

### Non-technical requirements:
- As a user I want to see my product widgets.
- As a user I want to customise my widgets by changing their colors, active state and
whether it’s linked to my public profile (using client-side state management)
- Only one widget can have the active state at a time
- While there isn't a strict deadline, completing the task should ideally only take a few
hours. We hope to receive your solution within one week.

### Technical requirements:
- You can find a Figma prototype for the UI design here. Please make sure that you sign
up/login to Figma, so you can investigate the design details. We also recommend
making a copy of the design for yourself.
- You can fetch the product widget DTOs and its initial properties from
https://b795b019-1f84-41f4-93a3-a702d686c75a.mock.pstmn.io/product-widgets
- The initial properties should be reflected on page mount
- The UI can be implemented using any well-known framework or library (FYI, we use
Vue.js, Vuex and Typescript)
- Please include a README describing what you’ve done and why, as well as instructions
on how to run and use the service.
- Finish the task by implementing simple, but production-ready, clean code. We would like
you to be proud of the quality of your final code.
- Optional: Write appropriate tests for your frontend service (unit, Storybook)
